## What I Learned
To check for a winner in a tic-tac-toe game, the Board would need to somehow know the state of each of the 9 Square components.
-The best approach is to store the gameâ€™s state in the parent Board component instead of in each Square. The Board component can tell each Square what to display by passing a prop, like you did when you passed a number to each Square.

To collect data from multiple children, or to have two child components communicate with each other,i declared the shared state in their parent component instead. The parent component can pass that state back down to the children via props. This keeps the child components in sync with each other and with their parent.

## Brief explanation on main state handling

Clicking on any square runs the function that the button received as its onClick prop from the Square. The Square component received that function as its onSquareClick prop from the Board. The Board component defined that function directly in the JSX. It calls handleClick with an argument of 0.
handleClick uses the argument (0) to update the first element of the squares array from null to X.
The squares state of the Board component was updated, so the Board and all of its children re-render. This causes the value prop of the Square component with index 0 to change from null to X.

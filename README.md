## What I Learned
To check for a winner in a tic-tac-toe game, the Board would need to somehow know the state of each of the 9 Square components.
-The best approach is to store the gameâ€™s state in the parent Board component instead of in each Square. The Board component can tell each Square what to display by passing a prop, like you did when you passed a number to each Square.

To collect data from multiple children, or to have two child components communicate with each other,i declared the shared state in their parent component instead. The parent component can pass that state back down to the children via props. This keeps the child components in sync with each other and with their parent.
